# Logical operators

> Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere. (Albert Einstein)

---

# Exercise: and

Write a function `logical_and()` that, given too boolean arguments, returns true if both arguments are true (and false otherwise):

```lua
function logical_and(a,b)
    -- your code here
end

print(logical_and(false, false))  -- false
print(logical_and(false, true))   -- false
print(logical_and(true, false))   -- false
print(logical_and(true, true))    -- true
```

---

# Solution: and

```lua
function logical_and(a,b)
    if a then
        if b then
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

or shorter:

```lua
function logical_and(a,b)
    if a then
        return b
    else
        return false
    end
end
```

---

# Exercise: or

Write a function `logical_or()` that, given too boolean arguments, returns true if at least one argument is true (and false otherwise):

```lua
function logical_or(a,b)
    -- your code here
end

print(logical_or(false, false))  -- false
print(logical_or(false, true))   -- true
print(logical_or(true, false))   -- true
print(logical_or(true, true))    -- true
```

---

# Solution: or

```lua
function logical_or(a,b)
    if a then
        return true
    elseif b then
        return true
    end

    return false
end
```

Or shorter:

```lua
function logical_or(a,b)
    if a then
        return true
    else
        return b
    end
end
```

---

# Exercise: not

Write a function `logical_not()` that, given true, returns false, and vice versa:

```lua
function logical_not(a)
    -- your code here
end

print(logical_not(true))   -- false
print(logical_not(false))  -- true
```

---

# Solution: not

```lua
function logical_not(a)
    if a then
        return false
    else
        return true
    end
end
```

Or shorter:

```lua
function logical_not(a)
    return a ~= true
end
```

---

# Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`

These three logical operations exist as the operators `and`, `or`, and `not`:

```lua
print(false and false)  -- false
print(false and true)   -- false
print(true and false)   -- false
print(true and true)    -- true

print(false or false)  -- false
print(false or true)   -- true
print(true or false)   -- true
print(true or true)    -- true

print(not false)       -- true
print(not true)        -- false
```

In (mathematical) logic:

- "A and B" means "both A and B are true"
- "A or B" means "either A or B (or both) are true"
- "not A" means "A is not true"

---

# More logic

These operators take booleans, and form boolean expressions. As such, they can be used as conditions in `if`, and `while`:

```lua
N = 50
if N % 2 == 0 and N > 100 then
    print(N .. " is odd, and bigger than 100!")
end
```

They can use variables:

```lua
N = 100
isOdd = N % 2 == 0
isBig = N > 50

if isOdd and isBig then
    print(N .. " is odd, and bigger than 100!")
end
```

---

# Saving booleans

...and their results can be saved in variables:

```lua
isRaining = true
haveUmbrella = false

willGoForAWalk = (isRaining and haveUmbrella) or not isRaining
```

Like other operations, they can be chained as much as you want:

```lua
if a and b and c and d then
    print("a, b, c and d are all true!")
end

if a or b or c or d then
    print("At least one of a, b, c or d is true!")
end
```

---

# Mini exercise: logical operators

Complete the following program so that it prints all elements of the array that:

- start or end with the letter "a"
- contain more than 5 letters and can be cut in three equal parts

```lua
words = {"avocado", "burrito", "enchilada",
	"guacamole", "tequila", "mojito", "ola"}

-- your code here
```

# Tables

> A single conversation across the table with a wise man is better than ten years' study of books. (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow)

---

# Tables

Arrays are a special case of a more general type: the table. A table associates *keys* with *values*. Syntax to set or get elements of a table is the same as arrays (because arrays *are* tables): `name[key]`

```lua
age = {}      -- create empty table
age["Alice"] = 10
age["Bob"] = 5
age["Charlie"] = 22
```

| Key     | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Alice   | 10    |
| Bob     | 5     |
| Charlie | 22    |

---

# Types in tables

Can mix types as much as wanted:

```lua
t = {}
t["Hello"] = 10
t[2.5] = true
t[false] = "Whatever"
```

| Key     | Value      |
|---------|------------|
| "Hello" | 10         |
| 2.5     | true       |
| false   | "Whatever" |

**Note**: the only thing you cannot do is use nil as a key.

---

# Retrieving from tables

To get an element, same syntax as arrays: `table[key]`:

```lua
t = {}
t["Hello"] = 10
t[2.5] = true
t[false] = "Whatever"
t["Foo"] = "Bar"

print(t["Hello"])
print(t[2.5])
print(t[false])
print(t["Foo"])
```

---

# Keys

Just like arrays, the key can be any expression (including using a variable or an operation):

```lua
t = {}
key = "Foo"
t[key] = 23
t[key .. key] = -2.4

print(t[key])       -- 23
print(t["FooFoo"])  -- -2.4
```

Just like arrays, trying to access an element which is not in the table will return nil:

```lua
t = {}
print(t["Blah"])    -- nil
```

---

# Erasing elements

...and erasing an element from the table can be done by assigning nil:

```lua
t = {}
t[3.5] = false
print(t[3.5])   -- false
t[3.5] = nil
print(t[3.5])   -- nil
```

---

# Table recap

Not much is new! Works the same as arrays, except that the index (or "key") can be of any type. Arrays are simply tables were all keys are positive integers.

**Reminder**: when all keys are consecutive positive integers, we have "special" things that we can do with the table:

- use the length operator `#`
- use `table.insert` and `table.remove`

But really, we've been using tables all along!

---

# Mini exercises: tables

- Using a table, write a program that greets a user according to their name. If it's Alice, say "Hello Alice", if it's Bob, say "Oh hi, Bob!", and if it's Charlie, say "Charlie, so nice to see you!". If it's someone else, just say "Welcome".

- Fill a table `age` with the following information, and write a function that prints results such as "You are Alice, you are 22 years old.", or an error message if the person is unknown:

| Key     | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Alice   | 22    |
| Bob     | 5     |
| Charlie | 65    |
| Dorothy | 34    |
| Emily   | 50    |
