# Pattern captures

> The photograph itself doesn't interest me. I want only to capture a minute part of reality. (Henri Cartier-Bresson)

![Henri Carter-Bresson](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/06/20/blogs/20130620-lens-bresson-slide-IVP4/20130620-lens-bresson-slide-IVP4-superJumbo.jpg)

# Captures

In a pattern, we can define *captures*: parts of the patterns enclosed in parentheses `()`. When the pattern matches, the substrings that correspond to captures are stored ("captured") for future use.

The pattern `"(%w+) = (%d+)"` has two captures. The first one is `%w+` and the second one is `%d+`.

Depending on the function we use, captures have different effects.

---

# Captures in `string.match()`

If the pattern passed to `string.match()` contains captures, and the pattern matched, the captured strings are returned.

```lua
-- looking for a word following "Hello":
s = "Hello world!"

capture = string.match(s, "Hello (%a+)")
print(capture)

--> world
```

**Reminder:** without captures, the whole match is returned:

```lua
-- looking for a word following "Hello":
s = "Hello world!"

match = string.match(s, "Hello %a+")
print(match)

--> Hello world
```

---

# Multiple captures

When multiple captures are defined, they are all returned:

```lua
s = "My birthday is the 02/09/1987"

day, month, year = string.match(s, "(%d%d)/(%d%d)/(%d%d%d%d)")
print(day, month, year)

--> 02	09	1987
```

**Note:** the matches are always strings. To convert strings into the numbers they represent, use the `tonumber()` function:

```lua
s = "1029"
n = tonumber(s)
print(n > 1000)	--> true
print(s > 1000)	--> error!
```

---

# Captures and `string.find()`

When passing a pattern with captures to `string.find()`, the captures are returned after the indices of start and end of the match.

```lua
s = "My birthday is the 02/09/1987"

start, finish, day, month, year =
	string.find(s, "(%d%d)/(%d%d)/(%d%d%d%d)")
print("Found date at:", start, finish)
print("Date was:", day, month, year)

--> Found date at:	20	29
--> Date was:	02	09	1987
```

---

# Using capture results in patterns

The result of a capture can be used in the pattern itself: the special sequence `%i` (where `i` is a digit from 1 to 9) represents the text that was matched by the `i`-th capture:

```lua
s = "I accidentally wrote the the same word twice."

word = string.match(s, "(%a+) %1")
print("Repeated word: " .. word)

--> Repeated word: the
```

---

# Captures and `string.gsub()`

When defining captures in a pattern passed to `string.gsub()`, you can use the `%i` sequences in the replacement string. Additionally, `%0` represents the whole match:

```lua
s = "My pretty little string."

-- duplicate every word
print(string.gsub(s, "%a+", "%0 %0"))
--> My My pretty pretty little little string string.	4

-- swap letters around spaces
print(string.gsub(s, "(%a) (%a)", "%2 %1"))
--> Mp yrettl yittls etring.	3

-- enclose every double letter in underscores
print(string.gsub(s, "(%a)%1", "_%0_"))
--> My pre_tt_y li_tt_le string.	2
```

---

# `string.gmatch()`

Used with the generic for loop `for in end`, will iterate over all matches of the pattern in a given string:

```lua
s = "I lost the stupid soot."
for word in string.gmatch(s, "%a+") do
	print(word)
end
```

Outputs:

```
I
lost
the
stupid
soot
```

---

# `string.gmatch()`

If the pattern defines captures, they are all returned:

```lua
s = "I played A2, they played F17"
for row, column in string.gmatch(s, "(%a)(%d+)") do
	print(row, column)
end
```

Outputs:

```
A	2
F	17
```

---

# `io.lines()`

Used in a generic for loop, reads an entire file line by line:

```lua
for line in io.lines("somefile.txt") do
	print(line)
end
```

---

# Exercises: database processing

The file [clients.csv](exercises/clients/clients.csv) contains a database of clients, in the CSV format (comma separated values):

```lua

```

# Loading the database

First, write a function `split(s)` that splits a string `s` into substrings separated by the character `;`: for instance, `split("foo;bar;baz;meh")` would return the array `{"foo","bar","baz","meh"}`. There are several ways to do that, using `string.find()` or `string.gmatch()`.

Then, write a function `load_database()` that:

- Reads all lines of the CSV file, using `io.lines()`
- Splits each line into individual fields.
- In each line, gathers the data fields into a table with keys `Username`, `GivenName`, etc. (which are the fields of the first line).
- Saves all the tables in an array, and returns it.

Once done, you should be able to get the data as follows:

```lua
-- Print the address of client 243
local clients = load_database()
print(#clients)						 --> 50000
print(clients[243]["StreetAddress"]) --> "Byggðavegur 80"
```

---

# Current date

Useful for next questions:

```lua
date = os.date("*t")

for k,v in pairs(date) do
	print(k,v)
end
```

```
hour	15
min	41
wday	3
day	20
month	10
year	2015
sec	50
yday	293
isdst	true
```

Called without argument, returns a string in an OS dependent format: `10/20/15 15:41:50`

---

# Questions

All these functions should take as parameter the list of clients as returned by `load_database()`.

- Write a function `count_genders(clients)` that returns the number of men and women in the database
- Write a function `average_age(clients)` that returns the average age of the clients
	- you can deduce the age from the birthday
	- remember, you can use `tonumber()` to convert a string into the number it represents
- Modify the previous function to also return the median age
	- gather all ages in an array
	- sort the array using `table.sort(array)`
	- return the middle element
- Write a `photo(clients)` function that prints the username and job of all clients in Tunisia that have something to do with photography (ie. they occupation contains "photo")
	- you can use `string.lower(s)` to get a lowercase version of string `s`

---

# Questions

```lua
function email(address, message)
	print("Email to " .. address .. ": " .. message)
end
```

- Using the dummy email function above, write a function `birthdays(clients)` that sends a personalised "Happy birthday" email to everyone whose birthday it is today (remember `os.date("*t")`)
- Write a function `countries_stats(clients)` that prints how many clients we have in each country

# User input

> The word user is the word used by the computer professional when they mean idiot. (Dave Barry)

---

# `io.read()`

Reads text from the "standard input":

- typed in the command prompt/terminal
- output of another program "piped" into the program

Used without argument, reads one line of text (ie. program blocks until you type enter):

```lua
line = io.read()
print("You typed: " .. line)
```

---

# Mini exercise: echo

Write a program that repeats all you type, until you type "quit", after which it exits.

```
W:\Perso\devtut\exercises\104>lua echo.lua
Hello?
Hello?
What is this?
What is this?
Pretty cool.
Pretty cool.
quit

# Number guessing game

- program picks a random number
- you take a guess, program tells you if your number is too big or too small
- game ends when you find the solution

```
W:\Perso\devtut\exercises\104>lua guessing.lua
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I am thinking of a number between 1 and 1000
Take a guess:
400
Too big!
Take a guess:
200
Too small!
Take a guess:
foobar
Hey, foobar is not a number!
Take a guess:
252
You got it, in 3 tries!
Thanks for playing!

# Guessing game: steps

- game setup: pick a random number
	- seed the random number generator: `math.randomseed(os.time())`
	- `math.random(max)` returns an integer between 1 and `max`
- write the basic "game loop":
	- input
	- check value
	- output accordingly (too big, too small, ok)
- add a check that the input is valid
- add indications to the user (at the beginning, before they need to type something, at the end, etc.)
- add a counter that tells the user how many tries it took them

# Tic-tac-toe: data structure

- the grid is an array of 3 rows, and each row is an array of 3 numbers
- the numbers are 0 if the cell is empty, and 1 or 2 if a player played there
- accessing a cell is done with `grid[row][column]`
- write function `make_grid()` that returns an empty grid (an array of 3 arrays containing 3 zeros)
- write function `print_grid(grid)` that, given a grid in this format, prints it using the characters `+-|XO` and spaces:

```
   |   | X
---+---+---
   | O |
---+---+---
   |   |   
```

- write a function `check_win(grid)` that, given a grid, checks if one player has three signs in a row, in a column, or in a diagonal. It should return 1 or 2 if that's the case (which player won) or `nil` if no player won yet.

---

# Tic-tac-toe: user input

Write a function `get_input(grid)` that:

- reads input
- interprets it as `line,column` to get two numbers
- checks that these numbers are:
	- between 1 and 3
	- represent an empty cell in the grid
- if all good, return them
- else complain and loop

---

# Tic-tac-toe: game loop

Finally, write a `play()` function that:

- creates a new grid
- has a variable that keeps track of whose player it is the turn
- loops until the game is over:
	- print the grid
	- tell which player will play
	- get user input
	- set the chosen cell of the grid to the player number
	- check for a winner
		- if there is one, congratulate and exit
		- otherwise, switch to other player and loop

Don't forget to call your `play()` function :)

---

# Tic-tac-toe: what else?

Can experiment with "AI":

- instead of asking input for player 2, call a function that will decide where to play
- basic "strategy": pick a random free cell
- better "strategy":
	- if a cell would give the win, play there
	- if a cell would give the win to the other next turn, play there
	- if you can build two alignments of 2 cells, play there

Graphical user interface: after we know the language basics :)
