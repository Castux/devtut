# Pattern captures

> The photograph itself doesn't interest me. I want only to capture a minute part of reality. (Henri Cartier-Bresson)

# Captures

In a pattern, we can define *captures*: parts of the patterns enclosed in parentheses `()`. When the pattern matches, the substrings that correspond to captures are stored ("captured") for future use.

The pattern `"(%w+) = (%d+)"` has two captures. The first one is `%w+` and the second one is `%d+`.

Depending on the function we use, captures have different effects.

# Captures in `string.match()`

If the pattern passed to `string.match()` contains captures, and the pattern matched, the captured strings are returned.

```lua
-- looking for a word following "Hello":
s = "Hello world!"

capture = string.match(s, "Hello (%a+)")
print(capture)
```

**Reminder:** without captures, the whole match is returned:

```lua
-- looking for a word following "Hello":
s = "Hello world!"

match = string.match(s, "Hello %a+")
print(match)
```

---

# Multiple captures

When multiple captures are defined, they are all returned:

```lua
s = "My birthday is the 02/09/1987"

day, month, year = string.match(s, "(%d%d)/(%d%d)/(%d%d%d%d)")
print(day, month, year)
```

**Note:** the matches are always strings. To convert strings into the numbers they represent, use the `tonumber()` function:

```lua
s = "1029"
n = tonumber(s)
print(n > 1000)	--> true
print(s > 1000)	--> error!
```

---

# Captures and `string.find()`

When passing a pattern with captures to `string.find()`, the captures are returned after the indices of start and end of the match.

```lua
s = "My birthday is the 02/09/1987"

start, finish, day, month, year = string.find(s, "(%d%d)/(%d%d)/(%d%d%d%d)")
print("Found date at:", start, finish)
print("Date was:", day, month, year)
```

---

# Nested captures

Captures can be nested (contain other captures), in which case they are returned in the order of their opening parentheses `(`:

```lua
s = "I found a bunny rabbit"

-- looking for a sequence of two words, following "a ",
-- the first one starting in b
both, first, second = string.match(s, "a ((b%a*) (%a+))")
print(both)
print(first, second)
```

---

# Using capture results in patterns

The result of a capture can be used in the pattern itself: the special sequence `%i` (where `i` is a digit from 1 to 9) represents the text that was matched by the `i`-th capture:

```lua
s = "I accidentally wrote the the same word twice."

word = string.match(s, "(%a+) %1")
print("Repeated word: " .. word)
```

---

# Captures and `string.gsub()`

When defining captures in a pattern passed to `string.gsub()`, you can use the `%i` sequences in the replacement string. Additionally, `%0` represents the whole match:

```lua
s = "My pretty little string."

-- duplicate every word
print(string.gsub(s, "%a+", "%0 %0"))
--> My My pretty pretty little little string string.	4

-- swap letters around spaces
print(string.gsub(s, "(%a) (%a)", "%2 %1"))
--> Mp yrettl yittls etring.	3

-- enclose every double letter in underscores
print(string.gsub(s, "(%a)%1", "_%0_"))
--> My pre_tt_y li_tt_le string.	2
```
