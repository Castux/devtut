# Running the interpreter

- Lua source usually in `source.lua` files
- From the command line: `lua source.lua`
- From a menu (or shortcut) in a Lua-friendly text editor
    - `Tools -> Build` or `Ctrl-B` in Sublime Text
- One program = one Lua file (for now)
- Interpreter reads the whole file and executes it line by line

For very small tests: interactive Lua interpretor

- Windows: Start menu -> search for Lua -> "Lua (Command Line)"
- Others: run `lua` in a terminal

# Comments and whitespace

Comments: start with `--`, end at the end of line

- documenting
- separating sections in code
- disabling code temporarily

```lua
-- Here we print some things:
print("Hello world") -- the first thing
print("This is great") -- the second thing
-- print("Not this!")
```

Spaces, tabs and new lines ignored:

```lua
print(       "Hello world"
)print("This is great"          )
```

Good style: one instruction per line, consistent spacing
