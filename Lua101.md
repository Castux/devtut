# Before we start

---

# Running the interpreter

- Lua source usually in `source.lua` files
- From the command line: `lua source.lua`
- From a menu (or shortcut) in a Lua-friendly text editor
    - `Tools -> Build` or `Ctrl-B` in Sublime Text
- One program = one Lua file (for now)
- Interpreter reads the whole file and executes it line by line

For very small tests: interactive Lua interpretor

- Windows: Start menu -> search for Lua -> "Lua (Command Line)"
- Others: run `lua` in a terminal

---

# Comments and whitespace

Comments: start with `--`, end at the end of line

- documenting
- separating sections in code
- disabling code temporarily

```lua
-- Here we print some things:
print("Hello world") -- the first thing
print("This is great") -- the second thing
-- print("Not this!")
```

Spaces, tabs and new lines ignored:

```lua
print(       "Hello world"
)print("This is great"          )
```

Good style: one instruction per line, consistent spacing

---

# Basic output: `print()`

An instruction to print something to the console. Used mostly to:

- explain what is going on
- show the result of a computation

```lua
print("Hello, user!")
print("I will now print 5:")
print(5)
print("I'm done, bye!")
```

Can also print several things on the same line (separate them with commas):

```lua
print("The result was", 5, "and I had a blast!")
```

# Numbers

> If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is. (John von Neumann)

---

# Numbers

The most basic *type* of data you can use in Lua:

```lua
-- let's print some numbers:

print(123)
print(-2)
print(45.024)
print(-999999999.9)
```

Not that fascinating... Let's actually use the CPU.

---

# Basic number operations

| Operation      | Math notation | Symbol |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Addition       | +             | `+`    |
| Substraction   | -             | `-`    |
| Multiplication | × or ⋅        | `*`    |
| Division       | /, ÷ or —     | `/`    |

```lua
-- Lua as a simple calculator:

print(3 + 18.5)
print(20 - 5)
print(2763 * 47684)
print(60 / 4)
```

---

# Bigger operations

Can chain the operations as much as you want:

```lua
print(2 + 4 + 6 - 7 + 10 - 8 + 9)
print(3 * 4 * 10 / 2 * 5 / 10)
```

Like in math, `*` and `/` are applied before `+` and `-`:

```lua
print(3 + 4 * 6)    -- 27
```

Like in math, use parentheses `(` and `)` to force the order:

```lua
print((3 + 4) * 6)  -- 42

-- average of 5 numbers:
print((2 + 7 + 4 + 10 + 6) / 5)
```

# Memory

> A clear conscience is the sure sign of a bad memory. (Mark Twain)

---

# Variables: using memory

A variable:

- is a space in memory
- it has a name
- we can store a value (like a number) in it
- we can retrieve its content later to use other computations

![Storing data in a variable](http://img.c4learn.com/2012/02/Variable-in-Java.jpg)

---

# Storing data in variables

To store a value in a variable, we use the `=` symbol:

```lua
aVariable = 10
anotherVariable = 2 * 3 + 4
```

The computer will compute ("evaluate") what is on the right-hand side, and store the result in the variable whose name is on the left-hand side.

---

# Variable names

Anything you want with the following restrictions:

- contains only letters, numbers or underscores ("_")
- cannot start with a number
- no special letters (like ä, å, ö, é, etc)

Traditional styles for multiple words:

- camel case: `thisIsMyVariable`
- underscores: `this_is_my_variable`

Hint: in small programs, small variables are OK (`a`, `b`, etc.). In bigger ones, try to give them meaningful names, to remember what they represent.

---

# Retreiving values from variables

Simply use the variable name directly (in `print()` or in an operation):

```lua
-- storing
myVariable = 10

-- using
print(myVariable)
print(myVariable + 2)
print(myVariable * myVariable - 1)
```

---

# Retreiving values from variables

You can use as many variables as you need, and store new results in new variables:

```lua
-- simulation of buying a TV
money = 1000
priceOfTelevision = 200
moneyLeftAfterBuying = money - priceOfTelevision

print(money, priceOfTelevision, moneyLeftAfterBuying)
```

---

# Replacing values in variables

The name "variable" means that the value in a variable can change. You can reuse a variable as much as you want:

```lua
a = 10
print(a)    -- 10
a = 20
print(a)    -- 20, the 10 was replaced
```

A common idiom:

```lua
a = 100     -- or whatever
print(a)    -- 100

a = a + 1   -- this is called "incrementing"
print(a)    -- 101
```

---

# Absence of value

A variable that was never used doesn't contain any value. We say it "is nil", or "contains nil":

```lua
print(a)    -- nil
a = 5
print(a)    -- 5
```

Trying to do math with nil will make the interpreter angry:

```lua
a = 5
print(a + b)    -- whoops, b is nil
```

nil is a special value that means "no value", or "this variable is empty".

---

# Forgetting values

The nil value can be assigned to a variable to erase it, using the `nil` keyword

```lua
a = 5
print(a)    -- 5
a = nil
print(a)    -- nil
```

In general, you don't need to worry about saving memory or "recycling" variables.

---

# A bit of vocabulary

These symbols:

```lua
+ - * /
```

are called "operators". They "operate" on numbers. When, in the source code, we combine numbers and/or variables with operators, we form an "expression":

```lua
a + 4 * (b - 200) / c
```

Note: a variable by itself, or a number by itself is also an expression:

```lua
aVariable
100
```

When the interpreter encounters an expression in the code, it will "evaluate" it (compute its value by applying the operators, ie. "do the math").

---

# Expressions

We can put an expression directly in `print()` (to print its value):

```lua
print(200 * 246 - 2)
```

or in the right-hand side of an assignment (to store its value in a variable):

```lua
result = 200 * 246 - 2
```

Later, we'll see other places where we can use expressions.

# Text

> There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed. (Ernest Hemingway)

---

# Text

- "character strings" or "strings"
- another type of data that Lua programs can manipulate.
- sequences of characters
- in the source, they are written using `"` (double quotes)

We've already used them for output messages:

```lua
print("This is a string!")
print("This is also a string...")
print("These are ok: äåöÈ")
```

---

# Strings are values

Like any value, strings can be stored in variables and retrieved:

```lua
myString = "Hello"
otherString = "World"
print(myString, otherString)
```

---

# String details

You can also use single quotes `'`:

```lua
a = 'This is also valid'
```

Convenient if you need to put quotes *in* the string:

```lua
print("It's nice!")
print('What is this "string" you speak of?')
```

Strings can be empty:

```lua
print("")   -- well, that was useful...
```

Finally, "long strings" use double square brackets `[[` and `]]`:

```lua
a = [[These can be on
several lines, and contain both
single ' and double " quotes.]]
```

---

# String concatenation

Concatenate is fancy talk for "stick 'em together". It is done using the `..` operator:

```lua
print("Hello, " .. "world!")
```

It works, of course, with variables that contain strings:

```lua
name = "Clarice"
print("Good evening, " .. name)
```

And like the math operations, you can chain as many as you want:

```lua
name = "Dave"
action = "can't"

print("I'm sorry " .. name .. ", I'm afraid I " ..
    action .. " do that.")
```

---

# Fun with strings

Like with any operation, you can store the results of concatenation back into variables:

```lua
s = "Building a "
s = s .. "string in several "
s = s .. "steps!"

print(s)
```

Numbers can be concatenated to strings (Lua automatically converts the number into its representation as a sequence of characters):

```lua
numberOfCats = 120 * 2

print("I have " .. numberOfCats .. " cats!")
```

Convenient for outputing results of computations, in a nicely formatted message.

---

# String length

To count the number of characters in a string, we use the `#` symbol:

```lua
print(#"Hello!")            -- 6
print(#"This is great!")    -- 14
print(#"")                  -- 0

-- works with variables that contains string too:

aString = "Yeah!"
print(#aString)             -- 5
```

The length operator `#` works only on strings:

```lua
a = 100
print(#a)   -- the length of a number??
```

Note: special characters might count as 2 characters (details are... complex)

```lua
print(#"Å")     -- 2
```

---

# String length: just a number, really!

Note: the result of applying `#` to a string is itself a number, that can be stored and used in computations:

```lua
text = "This is some text."
length = #text

print("The text is " .. length .. " characters long.")
print("The double of that number is " .. length * 2)
```

Vocabulary reminder: `..` and `#` are *operators*. Using them to combine strings and/or numbers forms *expressions*. Expression have *values*, which are computed when the interpreter encounters them (they are *evaluated*).

---

# Types recap

So far, two kinds ("types") of values: numbers and strings, plus the special nil type (which means "no value").

The math operators (`+ - * /`) take numbers and produce new numbers:

```lua
10 + 20     -- the type of this expression is number
```

The concatenation operator `..` takes strings or numbers, and produces new strings:

```lua
"Begining and " .. "end" -- the type of this expression is string
"The result is " .. 100  -- the type of this expression is string
```

And the length operator `#` takes a string, and produces a number:

```lua
#"hello"    -- the type of this expression is number
```

Values (and therefore variables and expressions) have *types*: "what kind of data is this?"

# Truth and logic

> The truth is rarely pure and never simple. (Oscar Wilde)

---

# Comparing numbers

Checking if numbers are equal or different:

| Comparison       | Math notation | Symbol |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| Equal to         | =             | `==`   |
| Not equal to     | ≠             | `~=`   |

```lua
print(5 == 5)       -- true
print(4 ~= 10)      -- true
print(3 * 4 == 13)  -- false
print(2 + 2 ~= 4)   -- false
```

Like any operators, `==` and `~=` also work on variables:

```lua
number = 10
print("Is the number equal to 100?", number == 100)
```

The `==` and `~=` operators return a truth value: "is it true, or is it false?": it is the "boolean" type.

---

# Booleans

Another type in Lua, named after mathematician and logician George Boole.

- numbers can take values like 1, -4, 5.5, -90.3, etc.
- strings can take values like "Yeah", "Super duper" or "I have 2 cats!"
- booleans can take exactly two values: true or false

Booleans are values like any other. You can print them:

```lua
print(3 * 10 > 100)     -- false
```

Store them in variables and retrieve them:

```lua
a = 5
b = 5
aVariable = a == b
print(aVariable)    -- true
```

And operate on them (in a few slides from here).

---

# `true` and `false`

Just like:

- we can put numbers directly in the source (`a = 5`)
- we can put strings directly in the source (`print("Super!")`)

we can put booleans directly in the source, using keywords `true` and `false`:

```lua
print(true)     -- true
print(false)    -- false
a = true
print(a)        -- true
a = false
print(a)        -- false
```

Why we'd want to do that will become clear later :)

(*Note: values that appear directly in the source are called "literals"*)

---

# Ordering numbers

Checking which of two numbers is smaller or bigger:

| Comparison       | Math notation | Symbol |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| Smaller than     | <             | `<`    |
| Greater than     | >             | `>`    |
| Smaller or equal | ≤             | `<=`   |
| Greater or equal | ≥             | `>=`   |

```lua
print(4 < 5)       -- true
print(4 > 5)       -- false
print(20 < 20)     -- false
print(10 <= 2 * 5) -- true
print(4 <= 10)     -- true
```

Vocab recap: `== ~= < > <= >=` are *operators*, they combine variables and numbers into *expressions*. Specifically, they take numbers and produce booleans (truth values).

---

# Recap #2

We've now seen all the basic *types* in Lua:

- numbers
- strings
- booleans
- nil

and how to write them in the source code (*literals*)

```lua
5   -6.5
"A string"  'Another string'
true    false
nil
```

Plus a bunch of operators that can can operate on them:

```lua
+ - * / == ~= < > <= >= .. #
```

---

# Equality

`==` and `~=` work with all the types, not just numbers:

```lua
print(5 == 5)           -- true
print("Foo" == "Foo")   -- true
print("Foo" ~= "Bar")   -- true
print(true == true)     -- true
print(true == false)    -- false
```

Values of different types are never equal, though:

```lua
print(10 == "10")       -- false
```

Comparing to `nil` can be used to check if a variable is empty:

```lua
print(a == nil)     -- true
a = 100
print(a == nil)     -- false
```

# Control flow

![Calvin and Hobbes](http://sassyhacksaws.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/calvin-hobbes-peanut-butter.gif)

---

# The essence of programming

"Lua executes the instructions one by one, from the first to the last."

Well... not always. We can also choose what parts of the code to execute, depending on conditions. Typically:

- dealing with different inputs in different ways
- repeating instructions many times
- skipping unnecessary instructions in certain cases
- stopping the program early

Most *algorithms* (a plan to solve a specific problem) rely on this. Without control flow, a program would always execute exactly the same way, couldn't be interactive, etc.

---

# `if` control structure

The `if then end` keywords let you choose whether a sequence of instructions (a *block* of code) will be executed, according to a condition:

```lua
number = 10

print("Let's test our number.")

if number < 100 then
    print("The number is less than 100!")
    print("Isn't that crazy?")
end

print("Well, that was fun.")
```

Whether the to middle `print()`s will be executed depends on the content of the variable `number`.

---

# Booleans as conditions

The "condition" we give to `if` has to be a boolean: that's where we use them mostly.

```lua
if true then
    print("This will always be printed")
end

if false then
    print("This will never be printed")
end
```

It's interesting mostly when the condition is related to a variable (testing an input, the current state of the program, etc.)

---

# Blocks of code

A block of code can be any number of instructions, including none:

```lua
if someCondition then
    -- Do nothing! That's really useless!
end
```

and other `if`s:

```lua
number = 10

if number < 100 then
    print("Number is less than 100")
    if number >= 0 then
        print("Number is also more than 0!")
    end
end
```

Coding style: indenting. When starting a new block, *always* add an indentation (using tab key). When finishing a block (with the `end` keyword), remove an indentation.

---

# `else` block

Can add an `else` block, to execute when the condition is false:

```lua
age = 25

if age < 18 then
    -- reduction for youngsters
    price = 50
else
    -- full price for adults
    price = 100
end

print("When you are " .. age .. " years old, you pay " ..
    price .. "€")
```

---

# `elseif` block

Can add `elseif` block(s), to check for more conditions, in case the first one(s) fail:

```lua
username = "Alice"

if username == "Alice" then
    print("Nice to see you, Alice!")
elseif username == "Bob" then
    print("Oh hello, Bob!")
else
    print("I don't know who you are, " .. username)
end
```

Note: there can be any number of `elseif` blocks, plus an optional `else` block at the end.

---

# `while` loop

The `while do end` keywords let you repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.

Example, printing numbers from 1 to 100:

```lua
i = 1

while i <= 100 do
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
end
```

In real life:

- as a shortcut instead of writing the same instructions many times
- apply the same operation to a lot of data
- keep computing something as long as we didn't find the answer

---

# Fun with loops

Beware the infinite loop:

```lua
while true do
    print("Oh no, it's a trap!")
end
```

Loops are what gives a language its computational power to solve *any* problem in existence! They also let you write programs that never terminate.

- `if`: skip code, ie. jump forward
- `while`: repeat code, ie. jump backwards

They modify the *control flow* of the program. ("Control" means "what line of code are we executing now?")

# Bonus stuff

## Less important, but useful

---

# Numeric `for` loop

It increments a number and exits when reaching a value:

```lua
for i = 1,10 do
    print(i)
end
```

Can also specify a step, and go backwards:

```lua
-- even numbers
for i = 0,10,2 do
    print(i)
end

-- downwards
for i = 10,1,-1 do
    print(i)
end
```

---

# Breaking out

> Abort, abort!!

The `break` statement: exits a loop (`while` or `for`) early:

```lua
for i = 1,10000 do
    -- some computation
    if foundSolution then
        break   -- this will bring us...
    end
end
-- ... here!
```

---

# Breaking out

**Note:** `break` always breaks the innermost loop:

```lua
while something do
    while otherThing do
        if someReason do
            break   -- this will bring us...
        end
    end
    -- ... here!
end
```

---

# More math operators

Modulo operation (or "remainder of Euclidean division") using the `%` operator. Example: I have 10 pieces of pie, to share evenly for 3 persons. Each person gets 3 pieces, and 1 piece is left. 10 modulo 3 is 1.

```lua
print(10 % 3)       -- 1
```

Uses:

- when `a % b == 0`, we say that "b divides a" or "a is a multiple of b".
- when `a % 2 == 0`, a is even, otherwise it is odd.

**Note:** has nothing to do with percents, despite the symbol used.

---

# Even more math operators

Exponentiation (repeated multiplication): "b power n" or "b to the n-th power", b<sup>n</sup>:

![Exponentiation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/8/7f80d3b6fbe1d4e35eca5022242872bf.png)

Written in Lua with the `^` operator:

```lua
print(10^4)                 -- 10000
print(10 * 10 * 10 * 10)    -- 10000
print(2^10)                 -- 1024
```

---

# Scientific notation

Convenient for very big (or very small numbers):

| Decimal   | Scientific             | Lua       |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------|
| 300       | 3 × 10<sup>2</sup>     | `3e2`     |
| 7200000   | 7.2 × 10<sup>6</sup>   | `7.2e6`   |
| -533000   | -5.33 × 10<sup>5</sup> | `-5.33e5` |
| 0.04      | 4 × 10<sup>-2</sup>    | `4e-2`    |
| 0.0000034 | 3.4 × 10<sup>-6</sup>  | `3.4e-6`  |


```lua
print(3e6)          -- 3000000
print(3 * 10^6)     -- 3000000
print(2.5e-4)       -- 0.00025
print(2.5 * 10^-4)  -- 0.00025
print(2e6 + 2)      -- 2000002
```

---

# Multiple assignment

Can do several assignments on the same line, using `,` to separate the variables (on the left) and the expressions (on the right):

```lua
a, b, c = 1, "Hello", true

print(a)    -- 1
print(b)    -- Hello
print(c)    -- true
```

All the expressions on the right are evaluated first, and then only assigned to the variables. Useful to swap values:

```lua
a, b = 1, 2
print(a, b)     -- 1    2
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)     -- 2    1
```

# Roadtrip song

    99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer,
    Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
    98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer,
    Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
    ...
    1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
    Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
    No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. 
    Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.

Write a program that prints the lyrics to the song "99 bottles of beer".

---

# Drinking song

> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz,
> 13, 14, Fizzbuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, ...

Write a program that ouputs the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "Fizzbuzz".

**Reminder:** a is a multiple of b when `a % b == 0`

---

# Fibonacci sequence

> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

A sequence of integers starting with two ones, and where each number thereafter is the sum of the two previous ones.

Write a program that computes the first 100 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

---

# Factorial

The factorial of an integer N, denoted N!, is the product of all consecutive integers from 1 to N. For instance:

> 5! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120

and:

> 16! = 20922789888000


Write a program that computes the factorial of whatever number is in the variable `N`, so that for instance:

```lua
N = 16
-- your program
```

would compute 16!

---

# Palindromes

A palindrome is a phrase that can be read in both directions, like:

> A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!

In Lua, the function `string.sub` lets you extract substrings. Without going into the details, assume that `string.sub(s, i, i)` will return the `i`-th letter of string `s`:

```lua
print(string.sub("Great!", 3, 3))   -- outputs: e
```

Write a program that recognizes if a string is a palindrome. To simplify, assume there is no punctuation, capitals or spaces, so that the program would only need recognize `"amanaplanacanalpanama"` as a palindrome.

**Bonus question:** modify your program so that it ignores spaces, and recognizes `"a man a plan a canal panama"` as a palindrome.

---

# Prime numbers

A prime number is an integer that can only be divided by 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are:

> 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23...
