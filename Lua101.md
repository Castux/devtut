# Running the interpreter

- Lua source usually in `source.lua` files
- From the command line: `lua source.lua`
- From a menu (or shortcut) in a Lua-friendly text editor
    - `Tools -> Build` or `Ctrl-B` in Sublime Text
- One program = one Lua file (for now)
- Interpreter reads the whole file and executes it line by line

For very small tests: interactive Lua interpretor

- Windows: Start menu -> search for Lua -> "Lua (Command Line)"
- Others: run `lua` in a terminal

---

# Comments and whitespace

Comments: start with `--`, end at the end of line

- documenting
- separating sections in code
- disabling code temporarily

```lua
-- Here we print some things:
print("Hello world") -- the first thing
print("This is great") -- the second thing
-- print("Not this!")
```

Spaces, tabs and new lines ignored:

```lua
print(       "Hello world"
)print("This is great"          )
```

Good style: one instruction per line, consistent spacing

# Basic output: `print()`

An instruction to print something to the console. Used mostly to:

- explain what is going on
- show the result of a computation

```lua
print("Hello, user!")
print("I will now print 5:")
print(5)
print("I'm done, bye!")
```

Can also print several things on the same line (separate them with commas):

```lua
print("The result was", 5, "and I had a blast!")
```

# Numbers

The most basic *type* of data you can use in Lua:

```lua
-- let's print some numbers:

print(123)
print(-2)
print(45.024)
print(-999999999.9)
```

Not that fascinating... Let's actually use the CPU.

# Basic number operations

| Operation      | Math notation | Symbol |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Addition       | +             | `+`    |
| Substraction   | -             | `-`    |
| Multiplication | × or ⋅        | `*`    |
| Division       | /, ÷ or —     | `/`    |

```lua
-- Lua as a simple calculator:

print(3 + 18.5)
print(20 - 5)
print(2763 * 47684)
print(60 / 4)
```

---

# Bigger operations

Can chain the operations as much as you want:

```lua
print(2 + 4 + 6 - 7 + 10 - 8 + 9)
print(3 * 4 * 10 / 2 * 5 / 10)
```

Like in math, `*` and `/` are applied before `+` and `-`:

```lua
print(3 + 4 * 6)    -- 27
```

Like in math, use parentheses `(` and `)` to force the order:

```lua
print((3 + 4) * 6)  -- 42

-- average of 5 numbers:
print((2 + 7 + 4 + 10 + 6) / 5)
```

# Comparing numbers

Checking if numbers are equal or different:

| Comparison       | Math notation | Symbol |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| Equal to         | =             | `==`   |
| Not equal to     | ≠             | `~=`   |

```lua
print(5 == 5)       -- true
print(4 ~= 10)      -- true
print(3 * 4 == 13)  -- false
print(2 + 2 ~= 4)   -- false
```

Why we'd want to do that will become clear later ☺

# Comparing numbers

Checking which of two numbers is smaller or bigger:

| Comparison       | Math notation | Symbol |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| Smaller than     | <             | `<`    |
| Greater than     | >             | `>`    |
| Smaller or equal | ≤             | `<=`   |
| Greater or equal | ≥             | `>=`   |

```lua
print(4 < 5)       -- true
print(4 > 5)       -- false
print(20 < 20)     -- false
print(10 <= 2 * 5) -- true
print(4 <= 10)     -- true
```

We'll also come back to what
