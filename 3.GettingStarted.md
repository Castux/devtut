# Semantic nitpicking

- language: syntactic and semantic rules that describe a set of valid textual inputs, and their meaning
- computer language: a language somehow understood by a computer
- programming language: a computer language that describes instructions to be executed by a computer
- (source) code: anything written in a computer language
- algorithm: instructions to solve a specific problem (language agnostic)
- program: the implementation of algorithm(s) in a programming language, once compiled or interpreted. "A piece of software"

Not all computer languages are programming languages (eg. HTML describes data, not instructions).

- to code: to write in a computer language
- to program: to write a program, in a programming language

# Tools

To program, you will need:

- a computer
- a text editor (not a text *processor* like Word)
	- Notepad theoretically ok but...
	- Notepad++
	- Sublime Text
	- ...
- a compiler/interpretor for your language of choice
- (optional) some libraries written for your language of choice

Hence the need to pick a language.

# Picking a language

- if quite serious, C, for fundamental understanding of low-level computing, then C++
- if interested mostly in algorithmics, quick applications and practical things, Lua
- the more the merrier: never stop learning new things!

We will start with Lua.

# Lua 5.1

[http://www.lua.org](http://www.lua.org)

- interpreted
- dynamic (most checks happen at runtime)
- lightweight (few, sufficient features)
- simple syntax
- fast (for an interpreted language)
- very expressive/extensible
- widely used (Angry Birds, World of Warcraft UI, scripting of many very big games...)

Great stuff!

# Lua for Windows

An "all included" package:

- Lua interpreter
- A text editor (SCiTE) with Lua syntax highlighting and execution
- Many useful libraries

[Lua for Windows](https://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows)

# Checking the install

A good old "Hello World" program:

```lua
print("Hello, world!")
```

- save it in a file `hello.lua`
- run it from command line `lua hello.lua`, or from the text editor

Should output:

```foo
Hello, world!
```

# Lua ressources

- [Reference manual](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/): **all** there is to know. The entire definition of the language and its standard library
- [Programming in Lua 1st ed.](http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html): text book by the author of the language. Just as complete, but more accessible
- [lua-users wiki](http://lua-users.org/wiki/): snippets, FAQ, libraries...
- [Google](http://www.google.com/) is your friend
