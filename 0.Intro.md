What is programming?
====================

> Programming is making the machine do our bidding

The computer is an absolute slave: it does only and exactly what it's told, provided it's told in a language it understands.

---

Why do we program?
==================

Computers can do basic computations very fast (much faster than humans, billions per second). That's useful for:

- executing tedious tasks automatically ("booooring, let the machine do it")
	- counting words in a book
	- searching in databases
	- writing personalized email to a thousand people
	- solving sudoku
- solving problems that we know *how* to solve, but we never *actually* solved because it would take more than a lifetime
	- finding the billionth decimal of Ï€
	- cracking cyphers

Computers also have interesting input/output devices, which give them access to "non-human" powers, and by extension, gives humans non-human powers:

- video games
- sound synthesis
- networking

Anything you can think of, you can program and *make it happen*. Through language you can make worlds appear and set them in motion.

What can't we program?
======================

Computers are very fast for very simple tasks, which can be combined is less simple tasks that are necessarily slower. Very complex or "unnatural" tasks are typically slow, if even possible. Brains are very parallel in nature, and some tasks that are trivial for a human being are typically hard for computers:

- recognizing shapes in a picture
- finding an object in a collection in an instant
- doing anything "intelligent"

If you can break up a problem in simple sub-problems, odds are you can write a program to solve it. Otherwise, you'll probably have to cheat.

---

How do we program?
==================

Basically, we tell the computer what to do. To "tell" we need to write. To write we need a common language.

A computer is a very weak minded being. If it understands what you tell it, it will do exactly as told. Therefore, to make the computer your slave, you first have to let *it* be your master and impose its language on you.

Which brings us to...

Programming languages
=====================

Wikipedia has a [list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) of:

> all notable programming languages in existence, both those in current use and historical ones, in alphabetical order, except for dialects of BASIC and esoteric programming languages.

It's 644 items long. There are many way to categorize and compare these languages. Wikipedia's [list of programming languages by category](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_category) has 42 categories.

You can also sort them by family, which influenced which, which merged to give birth to others, etc.

So, where do we start?

---

General purpose languages
=========================

We want to make programs. Native desktop or mobile applications. For that we'll focus on general purpose languages. We can already remove:

- web oriented languages (JavaScript, PHP)
- scientific languages (MATLAB, R)
- application specific (VBA)

There are many programming paradigms, or philosophies behind the design of languages. Imperative, functional, object-oriented, concurrent, logic, etc. These are not all mutually exclusive, and many languages are advertised as "multi-paradigm". Without entering into details, let's assume we want to start with imperative languages. They are basically sequences of instructions, executed one by one. That is:

- natural enough to understand
- close to what is actually happening on the machine

---

High level, low level
=====================

One of the many ways to measure and classify languages is "how close the the machine" they are.

At the lowest level:

- machine code (the *only* language a processor actually understands)
- assembly (machine code but in human readable form. Very difficult to write what you mean, very easy to make mistakes. Basically impossible to maintain.)

Higher (disguised assembly, plus bonuses to make life easier):

- C, C++ (compiled languages, quite verbose, strict syntax, still very lax in terms of memory safety, error prone, but have many higher level constructs that makes coding more "logical" and closer to thought processes)

---

At the highest level (candy!):

- Python, Ruby, Lua (interpreted languages, concise syntaxes, very dynamic, they allow to do pretty much anything and it works, memory safe)

At first sight, why bother with lower languages, they seem horrible, while the higher level ones are dreamy? Speed. High level languages have more layers of things going on, taking care of all the things "behind the scene" for you, and that takes ressources. They can be as much as 10 times slower than low-level languages.

---

What's a good compromise?

- new modern languages try to combine efficiency of low-level languages with ease of use of higher level languages (D, Rust, Go). Still a work in progress.
- big projects combine and use different languages for different purposes. World of Warcraft is mainly in C++, with probably a bit of assembly for very speed critical code, and Lua for scripting and user interface.

---

Compiled vs. interpreted
========================

Compiled language:

- write source code
- give source code to compiler
- compiler converts source to machine code, thus creating a new program
- ask OS to run program
- machine code is loaded into memory, processor executes instructions directly

(C, C++, C#, D, Java, Rust, Go...)

---

Interpreted language ("scripting language"):

- write source code
- give source code to interpreter
- interpreter builds in memory a high-level representation of the source
- interpreter follows this representation and executes commands

The interpreter is a kind of simulation of computer: it is itself a machine that executes instructions. Hence the slowness.

However for many purposes (anything non computationally intense), interpreted languages are largely fast enough on modern machines. Can write full applications or video games with them.

(Lua, Python, Ruby, ActionScript, JavaScript...)

---

The final choice
================

"I want to learn to program. What language should I learn?"

Impossible to answer. Many coders end up knowing several, each adapted to different purposes. However, it is probably a lot harder to go from high-level to lower levels than the opposite. Lots of idioms in high level languages can be though of as "bad habits" that just won't work in lower level.

---

A compromise:

Go through an introduction to the C language to:

- understand the memory model of a computer
- learn discipline in programming (because in C you can't do without)
- know what happens behind the scenes of higher level languages (and thus program better with them)
- realize that some seemingly trivial tasks are a pain in the butt

---

In parallel, or after, learn Lua:

- can be learned in an afternoon (and mastered in a few more)
- seemingly complex tasks can in fact be trivial!
- popularity increasing very fast
- gorgeous construct: the Lua table combines goodies from other languages
- the fastest of the "slow languages"
- available frameworks for desktop applications and video games
- my personal favorite :)

---

"That was fun, I want more."
============================

- master the core concepts of C. You are now a real programmer.
- learn an object-oriented derivative of C
	- C++ is *the* most popular language to date
	- Objective-C for anything Apple related
	- D is "C++ done right", but is not so popular yet
- if nerd pulsions, take a look at assembly. Just for curiosity.
- whatever happens, don't learn Java.
- gratuitously diss Java programmers. If you don't know why, they do.
- create own programming language.
- abandon all hopes of having a social life again.
- create own operating system.
- reach singularity and access higher level of existance.
