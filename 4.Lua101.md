# Lua 101

## We have to start somewhere!

---

# Running the interpretor

- Lua source usually in `source.lua` files
- From the command line: `lua source.lua` (or `lua.exe source.lua` on Windows, depending on the installation)
- From a menu (or shortcut) in a Lua-friendly text editor

- one program = one Lua file (for now)
- interpreter reads the whole file and executes it (a "chunck")

# Before we really start

Comments: ignored by the interpretor

```lua
-- till the end of line
--[[till the closing brackets]]
--[==[till the closing matched brackets]==]
```

The `print` function: basic way to output (can take any type as argument)

```lua
print(5 + 6)	-- output: 11
```

Assignment to a variable (details to come)

```lua
a = 6
print(a)	-- output: 6
```
