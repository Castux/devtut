# Lua 101

## We have to start somewhere!

---

# Running the interpretor

- Lua source usually in `source.lua` files
- From the command line: `lua source.lua` (or `lua.exe source.lua` on Windows, depending on the installation)
- From a menu (or shortcut) in a Lua-friendly text editor

- one program = one Lua file (for now)
- interpreter reads the whole file and executes it (a "chunck")

---

# Before we really start

Comments: ignored by the interpretor

```lua
-- till the end of line
--[[till the closing brackets]]
--[==[till the closing matched brackets]==]
```

The `print` function: basic way to output (can take any type as argument)

```lua
print(5 + 6)            -- output: 11
print("This is great!") -- output: This is great!
```

Assignment to a variable (details to come)

```lua
a = 6
print(a)    -- output: 6
```

---

# Basic types and literals

Number

```lua
4     0.4     4.57e-3     0.3e12     5e+20     0xabcd1234
```

Internally: double precision floating point numbers

- integers from 0 to 2^53
- real numbers from 4.9 * 10^-324 to 1.79 * 10^308, with ~17 significant digits
- infinity
- NaN ("not a number")
- negative versions of all of these

---

# Basic types and literals (2)

String: a sequence of characters representing text

```lua
'blah blah'     -- single quoted
"blah blah"     -- double quoted
[[blah blah]]   -- long string

"This is a singly quoted word: 'horse'"
'Bob said: "Hi, I am Bob!"'
[[Bob said: "Hi, I'm Bob!"]]
```

Escapes: `\t` (tab), `\n` (new line), `\\` (backslash), `\'` (single quote), `\"` (double quote)...

"Long string" doesn't escape anything and allows newlines:

```lua
print( "Cool:\t\\" )    -- output: Cool:    \
print([[Cool:\t\\]])    -- output: Cool: \t\\
```
