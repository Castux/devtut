# Lua 101

## We have to start somewhere!

---

# Running the interpretor

- Lua source usually in `source.lua` files
- From the command line: `lua source.lua` (or `lua.exe source.lua` on Windows, depending on the installation)
- From a menu (or shortcut) in a Lua-friendly text editor
- one program = one Lua file (for now)
- interpreter reads the whole file and executes it (a "chunck")

---

# Before we really start

Comments: ignored by the interpretor

```lua
-- till the end of line
--[[till the closing brackets]]
--[==[till the closing matched brackets]==]
```

The `print` function: basic way to output (can take any type as argument)

```lua
print(5 + 6)            -- output: 11
print("This is great!") -- output: This is great!
```

Assignment to a variable (details to come)

```lua
a = 6
print(a)    -- output: 6
```

---

# Basic types and literals

> (computing) a classification or category of various types of data, that states the possible values that can be taken, how they are stored, and what range of operations are allowed on them

Number

```lua
4     0.4     4.57e-3     0.3e12     5e+20     0xabcd1234
```

Internally: double precision floating point numbers

- integers from 0 to 2^53
- real numbers from 4.9e-324 to 1.79e308, with ~17 significant digits
- infinity
- NaN ("not a number")
- negative versions of all of these

---

# Basic types and literals (2)

String: a sequence of characters representing text

```lua
'blah blah'     -- single quoted
"blah blah"     -- double quoted
[[blah blah]]   -- long string

"This is a singly quoted word: 'horse'"
'Bob said: "Hi, I am Bob!"'
[[Bob said: "Hi, I'm Bob!"]]
```

Escapes: `\t` (tab), `\n` (new line), `\\`, `\'`, `\"`, `\[`,`\]`.

In a long string, every character represents itself (doesn't escape anything and allows newlines)

```lua
a = [[multiline
stuff with unescaped
things: \'\\\t']]
```

---

# Basic types and literals (3)

Boolean: represents a truth value, can take exactly two values (true and false).

Corresponding literals:

- `true`
- `false`

Used in logic and to make branching decisions (what part of the code to execute).

```lua
a = true
print(a)   -- true
a = false
print(a)   -- false
```

---

# Basic types and literals (4)

Nil: absence of value

Any unused variable "contains" `nil`. We can assign `nil` explicitely to "forget" data.

```lua
print(a)    -- nil
a = 5
print(a)    -- 5
a = nil
print(a)    --- nil
```

Functions that do not return anything "return `nil`":

```lua
a = print("whatever")   -- whatever
print(a)                -- nil
```

---

# Basic types and literals (5)

That was the four basic types: number, string, boolean, nil.

The `type` function returns the type of its argument as a string:

```lua
print(type(5))        -- number
print(type("foo"))    -- string
print(type(a))        -- nil
a = true
print(type(a))        -- boolean
```

A variable doesn't have a type. Only its current value has. Lua is a *dynamically typed* language.

---

# Expressions

An expression is anything that has a value, and therefore, a type. Basic expressions are:

- variables
- literals

Expressions are built by combining smaller expressions with *operators*:

- binary (connects two expressions): `expression operator expression`
- unary (tranforms one expression into another): `operator expression`

Expressions can be grouped in parentheses when the meaning is ambiguous: `(expression)`

---

# Expressions (2)

Arithmetic operators operate on numbers:

```lua
a = 5 + 6       -- addition
b = 4 - a       -- substraction
c = b * b       -- multiplication
print(c / 2)    -- division
d = -c          -- (unary) negation
```

Other arithmetic operators:

```lua
print(2^10)     -- 1024 (exponentiation)
print(5 % 2)    -- 1 (remainder of division)
```

---

# Expressions (3)

We can nest expressions as much as wanted:

```lua
b = 1e3
a = 5 + 4 * 2 - ((7 + b) / 15)
print(a)    -- -54.133333333333
```

Operators `*` and `/` have *precedence* over `+` and `-` (like in math):

- `a * b + c` is `(a * b) + c`

Unary negation has precedence over all others:

- `- a * - b` is `(-a) * (-b)`.

When in doubt: parentheses!

---

# Expressions (4)

Relational operators *compare* things, and return booleans ("is this true or not?")

Order:

- `a < b`: is a strictly smaller than b?
- `a > b`: is a strictly greater than b?
- `a <= b`: is a smaller or equal to b?
- `a >= b`: is a greater or equal to b?

Works for numbers (natural order), and strings (lexicographic order).

```lua
print(5 < 10)                 -- true
print("rap" <= "rock'n'roll") -- true
print(5 >= "music")           -- error: attempt to
                              -- compare string with number
```

---

# Expressions (5)

Equality:

- `a == b`: is `a` equal to `b`?
- `a ~= b`: is `a` different than `b`?

Works for any types. Two values of different types will always be different, though.

```lua
print(5 == 2.5 * 2)            -- true
print(5 == "5")                -- false
print(type("meh") == "string") -- true
print((5 < 10) == true)        -- true
print(foo ~= nil)              -- false
```

Note: `==` is the comparison operator, `=` is for assignment.

---

# Expressions (6)

Logical operators: operate on booleans.

- `a and b` is true is both `a` and `b` are true
- `a or b` is true if either `a` or `b` is true, or both
- `not a` is true if `a` is false, and vice versa

```lua
x = 5
print(x >= 0 and x <= 10)   -- is x between 0 and 10 included?
print(x % 2 == 0)           -- is x an even number?
```

Note that, among other things:

```lua
a ~= b == not(a == b)
a <= b == a < b or a == b
a <= b == not(a > b)
not(not a) == a
```

---

# Expressions (7)

String operators:

- `a .. b`: concatenation (`a` followed by `b`)
- `#a`: length (number of characters in `a`)

```lua
foo = "This is" .. " great!"
foo = foo .. " Isn't it?"
print(foo)                  -- This is great! Isn't it?
print(#foo)                 -- 24
print(#"")                  -- 0
print(foo .. "" == foo)     -- true
```

---

# Expressions (8)

Precedence table for all operators (from low precedence to high precedence):

```lua
or
and
<     >     <=    >=    ~=    ==
..
+     -
/     *     %
not   #     - (unary)
^
```

All binary operators left-associative: `a ? b ? c ? d == (((a ? b) ? c) ? d`, except `..` and `^` which are right associative:

```lua
print(2^3^2)    -- 512
print((2^3)^2)  -- 64
```

When in doubt: parentheses!

---

# Type coercion

Number to string:

```lua
print("Twas the summer of " .. 70 - 1)    -- 69
print(10 .. 11)     -- 1011
```

String to number:

```lua
print(100 + "5")    -- 105
print("0xf1" + 2)   -- 243
print("5" + "2e3")  -- 2005
print("lol" + 4)    -- error: attempt to perform
                    -- arithmetic on a string value
```

When in doubt, use `tostring()` and `tonumber()`.

```lua
print(tonumber("1e4"))      -- 10000
print(tonumber("haha"))     -- nil
```

---

# Type coercion (2)

Anything to boolean:

> `nil` and `false` are false, anything else is true

```lua
print("yay" and 4 == 2 * 2) -- true
print("false" and true)     -- true
print(nil or true)          -- true
```

Real meanings of `and` and `or`:

- `a and b`: if `a` is true, return `b`, else, return `a`
- `a or b`: if `a` is true, return `a`, else, return `b`

```lua
print(true and 5)           -- 5
print(nil and true)         -- nil
print(false or "awesome")   -- "awesome"
print(200 or whatever)      -- 200
```

---

# Type coercion (3)

"Lazy evaluation": the unnecessary expressions are not even evaluated:

```lua
a = 50 or print("nope")     -- a = 50, nothing is printed
b = false and error()       -- b = false, no error
```

(Note: a function returns a value, so a function call is an expression)

Useful idiom: `condition and value or alternative`. If `condition` is true, `value` will be returned. Else, `alternative` is.

```lua
print(true and 5 or 10)     -- 5
print(false and 5 or 10)    -- 10

numCats = 10
str = "I have " .. numCats .. " cat"
str = str .. (numCats > 1 and "s" or "")
print(str)
```

# Statements

- a program (in imperative programming) is a sequence of *statements*
- statement: an instruction for the computer to execute, that changes the program's *state*
- state of program: the content of memory, peripherals, and the current location in the code 

Kinds of statements in Lua:

- function call: executing other pieces of code
- assignment: storing values in variables
- flow control: choosing what code to execute depending on some conditions

---

# Statements (2)

We've seen a few standard functions of Lua:

- `print`, which outputs its argument to the console
- `type`, which returns the type of its argument as a string
- `tonumber` and `tostring`, which convert their arguments to number and string
- many more
- our own functions! (later)

A function call, by itself, is a statement:

```lua
-- a valid program, which prints "foo"
print("foo")
tonumber("200")
type(3)
```

Note: a function call can also be an expression, as we've seen.
Note 2: the value returned by the function, if any, is lost (but the function itself is still executed).

---

# Statements (3)

Assignment

- syntax: `identifier = expression`
- meaning: "evaluate `expression`, and store result in variable `identifier`"

A variable is a space in memory which has a name, and contains a value. When we use the variable name later in an expression, the value is retrieved from memory, and used to evaluate the expression:

```lua
a = 5           -- store the number 5 in a variable called a
print(a + 4)    -- retrieve the value stored in a,
                -- add 4 to it, and pass the result to function
                -- print
```

Note: an identifier (variable's name) then can contain letters, numbers, and `_`, but cannot start with a number: `_fooBar`, `l33tH4xorz`, `camelCase`, `classic_case`, `Weird_Mix2`...
